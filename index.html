    <h1>My Favorite Books</h1>
    <p>As an avid reader, I know all too well the satisfaction of finding a good book to read. I am not one to gatekeep good reads, so here are the books that are making my shortlist of favorite books to read!</p>

    <div class="book-list">

        <!-- Book 1 -->
        <div class="book-item">

                <h2>Happy Place</h2>
                <h3>Emily Henry - 2023</h3>
                <p>Harriet and Wyn have been in a relationship for eight years but recently broke up and decided to keep it a secret from their loved ones. However, they struggle to maintain this facade when they go on their annual trip to their "happy place" in Maine with their friends. Throughout the book, Harriet and Wyn learn about forgiveness and understanding to place importance onto their relationship. I love how this book encapsulates the trials and tribulations of young adulthood and love in general. It was a heartwarming and humorous read that I will always go back to.</p>

                <h2>Kim Ji-young, Born 1982</h2>
                <h3>Cho Nam-Joo - 2016</h3>
                <p>Kim Jiyoung is a young South Korean woman who plays the role of a wife and mother. She begins impersonating other women without even knowing, causing her husband to call for help. The book comments on the social expectations and hardships of being a woman in South Korea especially, as well as the issues of systemic and societal misogyny, postpartum depression, and sexual harassment. I enjoyed how Cho brought this social issue into the light through this book and how she portrayed women's struggles in South Korea. I think this was a very enlightening novel overall.</p>

                <h2>When You Reach Me</h2>
                <h3>Rebecca Stead - 2009</h3>
                <p>Miranda is faced with a mysterious mission that she alone must face and figure out. At the same time, she is dealing with school, friendships, and family. The interwoven time travel aspect was written beautifully and brought a concealed science fiction element out of the book. I enjoyed reading this book several years ago and still remember how the plot twist was surprising and mind-boggling. I am a fan of how Stead writes and illustrates the scenes playing out throughout the novel.</p>

                <h2>Daisy Jones & the Six</h2>
                <h3>Taylor Jenkins Reid - 2019</h3>
                <p>Daisy Jones is a talented but troubled singer who eventually finds her place among the band The Six. However, she continues to juggle her addictions while making music with the band and gaining traction. After emotional turmoil and angst with the other band members among divisions within the band as well, Daisy Jones & the Six break up. I love how Reid made the characters very complicated yet relatable at the same time and still found a way to tie in a happy ending at the end. I love the characterization of Daisy and Billy and how Reid sheds light on the Hollywood industry and what it does to celebrities.</p>

                <h2>Clockwork Angel</h2>
                <h3>Cassandra Clare - 2010</h3>
                <p>Tessa Gray is abducted upon arrival in London by The Dark Sisters and is later saved by the Shadowhunters. She eventually begins discovering this new world and acquainting herself with Will and Jem. There is a constant battle between the Shadowhunters and their enemies, the clockwork automatons. This is only the first book out of the thrilling trilogy by Clare, who has written other books in the Shadowhunters universe. I loved being introduced to this world through this trilogy and appreciated how Clare wrote about the timeless love between Tessa, Will, and Jem.</p>
